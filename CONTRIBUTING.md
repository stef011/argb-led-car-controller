## Adding effects

If you want to add an effect, you'll need to create two new files in `include/effects` and `src/effects`. The name of these file will be the name of the effect. The file should contain a class that inherits from the `Effect` class. The class should have a method called `tick` that will be called every frame. The `tick` method should return nothing, but takes in parameters the `ledStrip` object and a `parameter` object.

To change the ledstrip color, you need to change the values in the table `ledStrip.leds[]`. The table contains the color of each led in a CHSV or CRGB object. You can change the color of a led by doing `ledStrip.leds[ledNumber] = CHSV(0, 255, 255);` for example.

The `parameter` object contains the values of the potentiometers. You can access them by doing `parameter->getBrightness()`, `parameter->getColor()` or `parameter->getSpeed()`. You can even directly access the potentiometer by doing `parameter->getPot1()`, `parameter->getPot2()`, `parameter->getPot3()` or `parameter->getPot4()`. And then calling a method on the potentiometer object, either `getValue()`, `getValue8()`, getValueHSV()`or`getLength()`.

`MyEffect.h`

```cpp
#include "Effect.h"

class MyEffect : public Effect
{
public:
  void tick(LedStrip *ledStrip, Parameter *parameter);
};
```

`MyEffect.cpp`

```cpp
#include "MyEffect.h"

void MyEffect::tick(LedStrip *ledStrip, Parameter *parameter)
{
  // Get the value of the potentiometer
  int potValue = parameter->getPot1()->getValueHSV();

  // Change the color of the led strip
  for (int i = 0; i < ledStrip.getLength(); i++)
  {
    ledStrip.leds[i] = CHSV(potValue.hue(), 255, 255);
  }
}
```

Once you have created these files, you need to add the effect name to the `EffectsEnum` in `include/EffectsEnum.h`.

```cpp
...
enum class Effects : int
{
  Still,
  ColorWipe,
  BackAndForth,
  Rainbow,
  MovingRainbow,
  Sinelon,
  MyEffect, // Add this line

  EnumCount
};
...
```

Then include `effects/MyEffect.h` in `Controller.h` and add the effect to the `effects` array in the same file.

```cpp
...
  Effect _effectList[static_cast<int>(Effects::EnumCount)] = {
      Still(),
      ColorWipe(),
      BackAndForth(),
      Rainbow(),
      MovingRainbow(),
      Sinelon(),
      MyEffect() // Add this line
      };
...
```

**NOTE: The order of the effects in the `EffectsEnum` and the `effects` array must be the same. If you want to add an effect in the middle of the list, you need to change the order of the effects in both files.**
